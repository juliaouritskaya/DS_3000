To ensure that your submitted `ipynb` file represents your latest code, make sure to give a fresh run `Kernel > Restart & Run All` just before uploading the `ipynb` file to Canvas.\n",

Pop into office hours or DM us in MS Teams if you have a specific question about your work or if you would like another pair of eyes or talk through your code.\n",
